I wish I had a thousand-yen note for every journalist who, over the past decade, has asked me whether Japan is still as futurologically sexy as it seemed to be in the '80s.
If I did, I'd take one of these spotlessly lace-upholstered taxis over to the Ginza and buy my wife a small box of the most expensive Belgian chocolates in the universe.
I'm back to Tokyo tonight to refresh my sense of place, check out the post-Bubble city, professionally resharpen that handy Japanese edge.
If you believe, as I do, that all cultural change is essentially technology-driven, you pay attention to Japan.
There are reasons for that, and they run deep.
Dining late, in a plastic-draped gypsy noodle stall in Shinjuku, the classic clich√© better-than-Blade Runner Tokyo street set, I scope my neighbor's phone as he checks his text messages.
Wafer-thin, Kandy Kolor pearlescent white, complexly curvilinear, totally ephemeral looking, its screen seethes with a miniature version of Shinjuku's neon light show.
He's got the rosary-like anticancer charm attached; most people here do, believing it deflects microwaves, grounding them away from the brain.
It looks great, in terms of a novelist's need for props, but it may not actually be that next-generation in terms of what I'm used to back home.
Tokyo has been my handiest prop shop for as long as I've been writing: sheer eye candy.
You can see more chronological strata of futuristic design in a Tokyo streetscape than anywhere else in the world.
Like successive layers of Tomorrowlands, older ones showing through when the newer ones start to peel.
