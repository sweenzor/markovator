74685801220407297 2011-05-28 20:57:37 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee ...yes?
74686790186958848 2011-05-28 21:01:33 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee Good for the interns...
74688370323898368 2011-05-28 21:07:49 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee Anyhow, Mudders are always welcome in my home. And I'm even here occasionally.
74689408896483328 2011-05-28 21:11:57 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee Heh. Jeans already in the tub tonight, eh?
74689871133949952 2011-05-28 21:13:47 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee lol.
74700505275830272 2011-05-28 21:56:02 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee My building has a washing machine... You can use it if you want, although I have clothes in it for the next 15m or so.
74700690542444544 2011-05-28 21:56:47 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee course, I don't know why you'd want to. Laundromats are cheaper and better.
74701519504687104 2011-05-28 22:00:04 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee the one I often use is nice enough.

74972810581245952 2011-05-29 15:58:05 PDT <Roguelazer> The Haight is really awesome.
74992812634030080 2011-05-29 17:17:34 PDT <Roguelazer> Listening to Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire "Oh! The Grandeur". This is awesome! Why didn't I listen to his earlier stuff, well, earlier?

75419898658041856 2011-05-30 21:34:39 PDT <Roguelazer> It angers me that if I tap the "Home" button on my remote, there is no easy way to get back to where I was in a movie.
75420047618748417 2011-05-30 21:35:15 PDT <Roguelazer> Also, BD movies with uninterruptible ads suck. Why do we have to pay so many usability penalties just to get slightly more pixels?
75420584590327808 2011-05-30 21:37:23 PDT <Roguelazer> This is the fourth time I've watched the unskippable "Universal" logo. Every action resets my place in the movie. #FuckingBluRay
75420981799305216 2011-05-30 21:38:57 PDT <Roguelazer> Make that fifth time. Why does the "Playback History" button irrevocably reset your position?
75421077521702913 2011-05-30 21:39:20 PDT <Roguelazer> Also, BD Live discs use my Internet bandwidth to download fucking previews? Like hell they do!
75421545383727104 2011-05-30 21:41:12 PDT <Roguelazer> Apparently, the only way to reliably jump to a position in a BluRay is to use the slow-ass Java menu system. Pirating = much better UX.
75790944443707392 2011-05-31 22:09:03 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee The top one looks like the best to use offensively to reflect laser beams into peoples' eyes. Go with that one.

85939251023319040 2011-06-28 22:14:48 PDT <Roguelazer> Apparently, I should be wishing you all Happy @avhn Day!
85963736518623232 2011-06-28 23:52:06 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee They were some pretty serious fireworks. Barely higher than my building, but as big across as the street.
86300646130712576 2011-06-29 22:10:52 PDT <Roguelazer> Didn't get into the datacenter at all today. Had to deal with a master db failure. And, on top of it all, I thought it was Tuesday all day.

86853981082632192 2011-07-01 10:49:37 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee All it takes is one person to sue you for not warning them of that. relatedly, contents of coffee cup may be hot.
86855579343130624 2011-07-01 10:55:58 PDT <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee "Contents may be hot" is dumb no matter how you slice it, sorry to say.

89767977754443776 2011-07-09 11:48:48 PDT <Roguelazer> It really bugs me how often Google does things that break the net. New versions of Chrome try to DOS every SSL site you visit. Annoying!
89768939961319424 2011-07-09 11:52:37 PDT <Roguelazer> @bjencks It preemptively opens SSL sockets (and does handshake), then keeps them around for 60 seconds in case you will use them.
89769127849365504 2011-07-09 11:53:22 PDT <Roguelazer> @bjencks Damned hard to distinguish between a DOS attack and a bunch of Chrome users holding open sockets and not sending data.
89769570868543488 2011-07-09 11:55:08 PDT <Roguelazer> @bjencks And if you close the sockets on the router (or load balancer or whatever) level, Chrome shows an error page to your users.
89770332793208833 2011-07-09 11:58:09 PDT <Roguelazer> @bjencks There's some Chrome bugs about it (it breaks Twitter), but they don't wait to get rid of the feature. Makes Google look faster.

89908112655523840 2011-07-09 21:05:39 PDT <Roguelazer> @Aiiane Not terrible, no. But CSS selectors + strongly functional design are nicer.
89916473795026944 2011-07-09 21:38:52 PDT <Roguelazer> @friedenberg Depends on where it is. In LA, that means slacks and a button-down shirt. In Boston, it means pants and a jacket, but not suit.
89916749297876993 2011-07-09 21:39:58 PDT <Roguelazer> @friedenberg Sneakers are not appropriate for business casual. And I personally believe that a blazer is always acceptable\n.

145764608874000385 2011-12-10 23:19:25 PST <Roguelazer> Google has IPv6 support. But they only serve AAAA records to whitelisted nameservers. You can demo at http://t.co/ptmUJFfT.

145766835441246208 2011-12-10 23:28:16 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Windows pre-Vista will try to use v6 even if all it has is a link-local address, and force users to suffer timeouts, iirc.

145990867998609410 2011-12-11 14:18:29 PST <Roguelazer> @jrheard Kindle 4 refers to the new (super-light) non-keyboard one. "Kindle with Keyboard" is the 3rd gen one. Also a good device.

298699481061392385 2013-02-04 23:48:00 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee One of the (possibly non-troll?) arguments I saw was that JS is the only language with significant uptake among women. #needsmoredata
298700459814834176 2013-02-04 23:51:53 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee It was bandied around on the forums. I didn't see any actual numbers, though. I feel like @Aiiane posted about some relevant things?
298700517801066496 2013-02-04 23:52:07 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Also, JS is a terrible language, and web and gnome developers of any gender deserve better.

298701946964029440 2013-02-04 23:57:48 PST <Roguelazer> @Aiiane I'm trying to find the source. I read a lot of mailing lists and comment threads when I saw the Gnome JS announcement this morning.
298702011417903104 2013-02-04 23:58:03 PST <Roguelazer> @Aiiane That rationale just stuck out to me as being the farthest in left field
298702268189007872 2013-02-04 23:59:05 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee My main problem with all of this is that JavaScript is so non-standard that GJS doesn't even run on anything except spidermonkey.

380187487487807490 2013-09-17 21:32:15 PDT <Roguelazer> @eevee Although uwsgi+virtualenv+symlinks generally = pain. Too many places where symlinks are lazily resolved.
380188344988082177 2013-09-17 21:35:39 PDT <Roguelazer> @eevee You have to use zerg for that, then. But then you're in the whole zerg flow, which is much harder to debug.

400708561216364544 2013-11-13 11:35:40 PST <Roguelazer> Little things that annoy me: when you send me a multipart mail that has a text/plain part... which contains HTML.
400708723133267968 2013-11-13 11:36:19 PST <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee A surprising number of websites require an action like "open a bunch of links and perform a repeated action on each target"
400712687685881856 2013-11-13 11:52:04 PST <Roguelazer> @vampirecoffee It's so much easier to just press "qa" and do what you want to do rather than writing code.

401231592900677633 2013-11-14 22:14:00 PST <Roguelazer> @John_Heidemann Yeah; it stays up for longer (a day or two) if I re-pair than if I just reboot, but it still requires periodic prodding.
401458709324234752 2013-11-15 13:16:29 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Couldn't you just maintain a global dict of all of them, and then hook into the event loop to update the global between every coro?
401460013245267969 2013-11-15 13:21:40 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Basically, just hook into asyncio.events.Handle to set up the right global before every callback invocation

420017291489603584 2014-01-05 18:21:40 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Or maybe if 3.0 hadn’t needlessly broken backwards compatibility (on silly things like u literals) and been 20% slower?
420017428404244480 2014-01-05 18:22:13 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee It wasn’t useful or straightforward to port until 3.2 or 3.3, and those are pretty recent.
420017714560638976 2014-01-05 18:23:21 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Even now there are lots of dumb syntactic things like metaclass syntax that make dual-version code unnecessarily hard.
420017912968015874 2014-01-05 18:24:08 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee And given that 3.3 is still sometimes slower than 2.7 and has almost no install base, expecting libraries to go 3-only is crazy.
420018149413498880 2014-01-05 18:25:05 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Depends. If it’s for public release, it does. Few people can run your app if it’s 3-only. I know I wouldn’t.
420018207483654144 2014-01-05 18:25:18 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee If it’s internal only and uses few libraries, maybe.
420018469929627648 2014-01-05 18:26:21 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Basically, I think adoption problems with 3 are almost entirely the fault of core python devs. Botched rollout all around.
420018628935704576 2014-01-05 18:26:59 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Only one of my systems has a 3.3 interpreter. Some can’t even run it unless I personally compile.
420018835077353473 2014-01-05 18:27:48 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee I am super against software which requires super-modern interpreter versions without very good reason.
420019171930284032 2014-01-05 18:29:08 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee I think it’s a crying shame that it’s taken 5 years to get to a usable state. Now it’ll take 5 more to get decent deployment.
420019415292190720 2014-01-05 18:30:06 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee The only 2.7 thing I am aware of is nested context managers. Everything else (argparse, etc) should be available as modules.
420019615540838400 2014-01-05 18:30:54 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Anyhow, interpreter and library stability is important to anyone doing operations or working on non toy software. Stable APIs matter.
420020057037492224 2014-01-05 18:32:39 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee Ah, I always forget that. I prefer to use the same format syntax as every other non-java language instead of learning a new one.

420023329731264512 2014-01-05 18:45:40 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee @jessenoller @glyph If you want those things, you need sqlalchemy 0.9, circa December 2013.

422520152693813248 2014-01-12 16:07:09 PST <Roguelazer> @chartier ISPs typically charge about 300% more than raw bandwidth costs them over the internet.
422520322244370432 2014-01-12 16:07:49 PST <Roguelazer> @chartier So any excessive demand problems they're having have to be in their own last-mile networks.

428044146901663744 2014-01-27 21:57:31 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee I'm reading _iomodule.c and I have no idea why it would end up thinking the buffer should be larger than the st_blksize value yet.
428045503704465408 2014-01-27 22:02:55 PST <Roguelazer> @eevee *shrug*. Anyhow, I'll change my code to just pass buffering=8192 I guess. It's 1 line shorter as python than as perl.

438212127317188608 2014-02-24 23:21:27 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance VPN is generally layer 2 or 3 encapsulated in layer 4 for purposes of privacy
438212199299829760 2014-02-24 23:21:44 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance VPC is an amazon term for a VLAN which you can connect a VPN to
438212287644450816 2014-02-24 23:22:05 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance And SDN is a largely meaningless term which Cisco uses to get people to pay for Nexus boxes instead of regular hardware
438212420075413504 2014-02-24 23:22:37 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance Theoretically, SDN means that packet forwarding is determined partially in software instead of entirely in hardware.
438212489684082688 2014-02-24 23:22:53 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance But the implications of that are left up to your nearest Cisco/Juniper sales rep and are nearly always meaningless
438212893448744960 2014-02-24 23:24:30 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance If you want to do something that requires SDN, you’re either Google or you have too complicated of an architecture. Or both.
438214482888638464 2014-02-24 23:30:49 PST <Roguelazer> @nuance The “Software” in SDN means “Something VMWare sells you that speaks Openflow and configures forwarding”, not your application per se

438928657948479488 2014-02-26 22:48:41 PST <Roguelazer> @synack Basically, you can push a principal through MDM and then Kerberize the device.

438931765466374144 2014-02-26 23:01:02 PST <Roguelazer> One last thought: Apple has a ton of trust in H/W suppliers. Almost every tech in that doc depends on the security of UID keys in the SOC.
438932841745768448 2014-02-26 23:05:19 PST <Roguelazer> @thwarted Remember: one of the technologies they use is Kerberos. "entirely new" is not an accurate summary.
438934627160305664 2014-02-26 23:12:24 PST <Roguelazer> @synack Yeah... If their fab partner added a back-door to write out the UID, almost every piece of crypto in iOS would fall.

446177108784451584 2014-03-18 23:51:26 PDT <Roguelazer> @glyph @eevee Threads without shared-state (message-passing) is definitely better, but reasoning about coroutines is harder than threads.

458422825183752192 2014-04-21 18:51:33 PDT <Roguelazer> @pagerduty why does the generic API let me pass a URL, but not the nagios integration API? Why is client_url not honored in nagios bodies?
458422943853211648 2014-04-21 18:52:01 PDT <Roguelazer> @pagerduty While I’m at it, why does the app enforce only displaying the Host for for service alerts from the nagios integration API?
